# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🧪 Supported Versions

we're just students building this together, so we don’t do full-on versioning or long-term support. but here’s how it works:

| Branch       | Supported         | Notes                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`       | ✅ stable only     | only gets tested + real updates, safe to use       |
| other branches | ❌ test stuff     | used for trying new features, might be unstable af |

if you're on `main`, you’re chillin. other branches are wildlands — no promises.

## 🐞 Reporting a Vulnerability

if you catch a bug, security issue, or anything shady:

- open an issue (label it `security`)
- or DM one of the devs if it shouldn’t be public

we’ll handle it as quick as we can (we're juggling exams too lol)

appreciate you keeping it safe 🫡
